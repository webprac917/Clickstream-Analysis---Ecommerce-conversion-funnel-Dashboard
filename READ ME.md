📘 Clickstream Analytics – E-Commerce Conversion Funnel Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes user behavior and sales conversion performance on an e-commerce platform using clickstream data. The objective is to understand how users move through the sales funnel, identify major drop-off points, and uncover device, browser, and category-level performance trends.

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize traffic behavior, device usage, browser engagement, and product category performance. The analysis revealed a significant gap between high website traffic and low purchase conversion, especially on mobile devices, indicating usability or technical bottlenecks in the checkout process.

🎯 Business Problem

The platform receives high traffic but suffers from low sales conversion. Business teams lack visibility into:

Where users drop off in the funnel.

Which devices and browsers contribute most to abandonment.

Which product categories perform best or worst.

Whether mobile users face UX or technical issues during checkout.

Without this insight, optimization decisions remain guess-based instead of data-driven.

Visualize the complete customer journey from product view to purchase.

Identify funnel drop-off points affecting conversion rates.

Compare performance across Device Type, Browser, and Traffic Source.

Detect critical UX or technical issues impacting mobile users.

Provide actionable insights to improve conversion and revenue growth.
